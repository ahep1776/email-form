# AHEP Email Form

Offline form for collecting email addresses at conventions.

## Usage

This is a simple HTML page that can be saved for offline access on a tablet.
The page provides a form for entering first/last name and email address.
Once an address is submitted, it stores the address in `localstorage` and
returns to a blank form for the next entry.  A separate page provides access
to download all the entries as a CSV file.
